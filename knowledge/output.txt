    pageContent: "Main Faqs\n\nWhat programming languages and frameworks does the platform cover?\nOur Frontend Developer Career Path uses HTML, CSS and JavaScript before moving on to React.\nWe also have an AI Engineering Path aimed at devs who want to learn about implementing AI solutions.\n\nDoes the platform offer project-based learning where I can build real-world projects?\nYes. All of our projects use real-world examples and all of our learning is project based.\n\nWhat is the format of the courses?\nOur courses use interactive scrims. A scrim is both a video player and a code editor. When you pause the video, you can edit the code the teach was working on. It’s really cool and you have to try it to believe it.\n\nDoes the platform offer live classes or is it self-paced?\nAll of our courses are streamed on demand, so it’s self-paced. We do have a weekly Townhall meet up on Discord and Bootcamp students have online meetings at fixed times.",
